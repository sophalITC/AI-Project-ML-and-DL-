# Facial Recognition Project

This repository contains the code for a facial recognition project designed to recognize faces from a dataset of 7 individuals. The project uses machine learning techniques and the OpenCV library to detect and recognize faces.

## Project Structure

- **dataset/**: Contains the images for training. Each subfolder is named after one of the individuals and contains images of their face.
- **ML1.py**: Main script for initializing the face recognition process.
- **face_dataset.py**: Script to collect face data and generate the dataset.
- **face_recognition.py**: Script for recognizing faces using the trained model.
- **face_training.py**: Script to train the face recognition model using the dataset.
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml**: Haar Cascade file used for face detection.
- **recordVedio.py**: Utility to record video from a webcam for further processing.
